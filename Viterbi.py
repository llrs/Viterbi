# Example of implementation of the viterbi algorithm for a  primitive clinic in a village.
# People in the village have a very nice property that they are either healthy or have a fever.
# They can only tell if they have a fever by asking a doctor in the clinic.
# The wise doctor makes a diagnosis of fever by asking patients how they feel.
# Villagers only answer that they feel normal, dizzy, or cold.
